📄 Cheat sheet for react native developers.

> Built with [mdx](https://mdxjs.com/) and [nextjs](https://nextjs.org/)

## Motivation

As a react native dev I found Flutter really similar to react native in many ways ([flutter for react native devs](https://flutter.io/docs/get-started/flutter-for/react-native-devs)). However when I first tried Flutter, turned out that doing simple things like fetchng data from back-end or building stateful component is not as straightforward as in React Native (actually it _is_ straightforward after the first time :smirk:)

Example:

React Native

```js
class Greeter extends React.Component {
    static propTypes = {
        name: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
    };

    render() {
        return (
            <View>
                <Text>Hello {this.props.name}!</Text>
            </View>
        );
    }
}
```

Flutter

```dart
class Greeter extends StatelessWidget {
  Greeter({@required this.name});

  final String name;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
        child: Text('Hello $name!'),
    );
  }
}
```

Looks pretty similar, right?
